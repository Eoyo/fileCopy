### configCopy is a copy from dva-cli , haha

### but I develop this one is aimed to help you generate the config file anywhere you want with node.js

## I will use the node.js to develop a cli tool that is named as 'configcopy'.
With ConfigCopy you can store the config files of yours into the cloud and share them, and download to anywhere you want;
At the start of this project, considering the deadline, I only want to realize the function of local file copy like dva-cli.

cloud file copy will be coming soon;
